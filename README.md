# NetCat

This project is a simple implementation of a group chat system, modeled after the NetCat utility, using a Server-Client architecture in Go. The server listens on a specified port and accepts incoming connections from clients. Clients can send messages to the group, and all connected clients receive the messages in real-time. The system supports multiple clients, ensuring that no client is disconnected when another leaves.

## Features

- **TCP Connections**: A server that listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port and supports communication with multiple clients.
 - **Client Management**: Each client is required to provide a name, and the server handles up to 10 concurrent client connections.
 - **Message Broadcasting**: Messages sent by clients are broadcasted to all other connected clients. Each message is prefixed with a timestamp and the sender's name, e.g., [2020-01-20 15:48:41][client.name]:[client.message].
 - **Client Join/Exit Notifications**: When a client joins or leaves the chat, all other clients are notified by the server.
 - **Message History**: New clients that join the chat are provided with the previous chat history.
 - **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for both the server and client sides.
 - **Port Flexibility**: Default port is 8989 if no port is specified. Otherwise, it listens on the provided port.
  - **Concurrency**: Utilizes Go routines and channels (or mutexes) to handle concurrency.

## Requirements

   - Go (Golang): Make sure Go is installed on your system.
   - Maximum 10 Clients: The server can handle up to 10 simultaneous client connections.

## Installation

Ensure you have go version 1.23 installed in your machine. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/khahussein/net-cat
cd net-cat/cmd
```

## Usage

To run the server you can use two ways:

 1. ```go run .```  This runs the default port 8989
 2. ```go run 2525``` This is a case where a port is specified, remember you can specify any port you want to.

To run the client you can also use two ways: 

1. ```nc localhost 2525``` This starts a client in the host machine.
2. ```nc $IP 2525``` This you must specify the ip address of the host machine and the port it is running on.

## Testing

This program has got test files and to test run the following command in the right directory.

```go test -v```

## Error Handling

The server and client are designed to handle various errors, including:

 - Connection failures
 - Server-side disconnections
 - Invalid inputs (e.g., empty messages)
 - Maximum client connection limits
